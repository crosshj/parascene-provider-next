## Following

- **Follow** — From a creation or profile, use Follow so their new posts appear in your [Feed](/feed). Use it to keep up with creators you care about.
- **Unfollow** — You can unfollow anytime. Your follow list is yours and isn't public.

Following creators shapes your Feed. For discovery beyond who you follow, see [Explore list](/help/discover/explore-list).
