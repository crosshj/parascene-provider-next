## Explore

[Explore](/explore) surfaces creations from across the community so you can discover new creators and work. What you see is driven by the network, not only who you follow.

When you find creators you like, [follow them](/help/connect/follow-creators) so their posts appear in your [Feed](/help/discover/feed-list).
