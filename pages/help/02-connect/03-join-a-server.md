## Connect and servers

[Connect](/connect) is where you see the servers that power parascene. Use the **Servers** tab to see available servers, boost, or run your own. Servers are run by providers and supply generation and other services.

**Use a server** — When you create, you use available servers. No extra step needed; the app connects you.

**Boost a server** — Pick a server on Connect and use the boost option to contribute credits. Boosting supports the network; it doesn't buy special treatment. For how boosting and competitions work, and how you earn credits, see [Boost and compete](/help/credits/boost-and-compete).

**Run a server** — Run your own server and earn when others use it. For requirements and how you earn (e.g. share of credits spent), see [Run a server](/help/credits/run-a-server).
