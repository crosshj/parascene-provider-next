## Your creations list

[Creations](/creations) is where your work lives. Use it to find, edit, [publish or share](/help/connect/share-your-creations), and manage everything you've made.

## Editing and managing

- **Edit** — From a creation's detail page, use Edit to change it. If it's already on your feed, republish so followers see the update.
- **Unpublish** — You can unpublish anytime. The creation stays in your list; you can edit and republish later.
- **Creations list** — All your work is under [Creations](/creations). Use it to find, edit, publish, or share.

To create new work, see [Basic](/help/create/basic) or [Advanced](/help/create/advanced).
