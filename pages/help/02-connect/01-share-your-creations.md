## Publish vs share

**Publish** — Makes a creation visible on your feed. People who follow you will see it. You can unpublish anytime and still edit and republish later.

**Share** — Copies a link to the creation. Send it anywhere; anyone with the link can open a share page that shows the creation and who shared it, with an option to join or sign in. Signups from your share link can be attributed to you where the product supports it.

## How to publish

1. Open a creation from [Creations](/creations) or its detail page.
2. Use **Publish** to put it on your feed.

To create or edit work, see [Basic](/help/create/basic), [Advanced](/help/create/advanced), and [Creations list](/help/create/creations-list).

## How to share

1. Open the creation and use **Share** to copy a link.
2. Send the link anywhere you like.
