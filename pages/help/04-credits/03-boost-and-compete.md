## How boosting works

Boosting means putting credits toward a server so it can do more for the network. It improves generosity and efficiency but **never guarantees visibility or authority**.

**Important:** Money buys possibility, not power. Boosting supports the community; it doesn't buy special treatment.

## Getting started

1. Go to the [Connect](/connect#servers) page (Servers tab) to see available servers.
2. Choose a server and use the boost option to contribute credits.

## Competitions

Providers can run events with pre-funded credit pools. You can participate (sometimes with buy-in) and earn credits as prizes. Check the [Connect](/connect#servers) page (Servers tab) for active competitions and rules.

Credits in competitions turn money into **culture**, not extraction.
