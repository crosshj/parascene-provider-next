## What credits are

Credits are the unit used on parascene for creation, boosting, and other supported actions. You earn them by participating and spend them to create, boost servers, or join competitions where supported.

Credits flow through the community: earning and spending stay visible and tied to participation. Your balance appears in the header when logged in.

## Daily credits

You can earn credits through daily claims when the product supports it. Check in-app for how and when daily credits are available.

For other ways to earn, see [Tipping](/help/credits/tipping), [Boost and compete](/help/credits/boost-and-compete), and [Run a server](/help/credits/run-a-server).
