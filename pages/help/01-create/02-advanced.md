## Advanced creation

Open the Create page to the Advanced tab: [Create (Advanced)](/create#advanced) or [Create (Basic)](/create#basic).

Use advanced creation when you want to refine results or try specific styles. Your account or template may expose more options.

- **Prompts** — Fine-tune your prompt and how it's used by the model.
- **Settings** — Adjust generation settings (e.g. steps, guidance) when the template or model supports it.
- **Model options** — Choose or tune model-related options for more control over output.

For a simpler, faster workflow, see [Basic](/help/create/basic). When you're done, save to your [Creations](/creations) list.
