## What is a server?

Servers are generation infrastructure run by providers. When you run one, you host image generation (or other capabilities), support the community, and earn credits when users create with your server.

## How you earn

When users create images using your server, you earn **30% of the credits** they spend—automatically credited to your account. Example: they spend 10 credits, you receive 3.

## What you need

- Generation infrastructure (hardware or cloud)
- Registration via the [Connect](/connect#servers) page (Servers tab)
- Configuration that meets provider requirements
- Uptime and support for users

**Important:** Providers don't own users or override system rules. Auth, identity, and moderation stay with the system.

## Example server

The [parascene-provider](https://github.com/crosshj/parascene-provider) repo is a minimal reference implementation: provider API (status and image generation), deployment to Vercel, and connection to parascene.
