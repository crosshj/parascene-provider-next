## Mission

parascene is a **P2P network for enthusiasts of the old and new** in machine learning, generative art, and algorithms. We put creativity, community, and technology in one place so people can create, share, and discover without gatekeepers.

- **Creativity** — Tools that support your ideas, not replace them
- **Community** — A shared space for creation, feedback, and collaboration
- **Technology** — AI, ML, and algorithms that make creation accessible

## Why it matters

We want creation to be first-class, algorithms to serve people, and value to stay with the people who make and use the work. parascene is built for that—one creation and one connection at a time.
