## Tipping

Tipping lets you send credits to creators to support work you like. When the product supports tipping, you can contribute directly from a creation or profile.

Tipping keeps value with creators and helps the community grow. For other ways to use credits, see [Boost and compete](/help/credits/boost-and-compete) and [Run a server](/help/credits/run-a-server).
