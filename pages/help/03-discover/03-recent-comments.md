## Likes and comments

Liking and commenting show support and help others discover work. Comments are tied to the creation and can form threads.

Recent comments and activity appear where the product surfaces them (e.g. on a creation or in activity views). Use them to join the conversation and see what others are saying.

For the Feed and Explore lists, see [Feed list](/help/discover/feed-list) and [Explore list](/help/discover/explore-list).
