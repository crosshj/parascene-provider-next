## Basic creation

Open the Create page to the Basic tab: [Create (Basic)](/create#basic) or [Create (Advanced)](/create#advanced).

Use basic creation when you want to get going quickly with minimal setup.

- **Templates** — Pick a template in the create flow. Templates give you starting prompts and settings; you can change them before generating.
- **Simple prompts** — Describe what you want in plain language. The flow guides you through the options that matter.
- **Presets** — Use presets when available to get good results without tuning every setting.

When you're happy with a result, save it to your [Creations](/creations) list. For more control over prompts, settings, and model options, see [Advanced](/help/create/advanced).
